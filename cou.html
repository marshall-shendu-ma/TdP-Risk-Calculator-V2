      <h2>Context of Use</h2>
      <p>Delayed ventricular repolarization can create a proarrhythmic environment that results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias including Torsades de pointes (TdP). A significant challenge in drug development and regulatory decision making is determining the proarrhythmic potential of novel compounds.</p>
      <p>The TdP risk categorization calculator tool is used to assess the TdP risk of small molecule compounds in healthy adults to create human-relevant data for greater evidence of safety assurance for drug development and regulatory decision making.</p>
      <p>Fitting of these results through machine learning algorithms were used to develop this open-source online calculator.</p>
      <p>This calculator receives compound-induced input predictors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Predictor 1: Did compound induced arrhythmias occur at any concentration? (0=no arrhythmia, 1=type A arrhythmia, 2=other arrhythmia)</li>
        <li>Predictor 4: Maximum repolarization change (ms) observed at any concentration.</li>
        <li>Predictor 7: Drug-induced repolarization change (ms) at Cmax.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Model 1:</strong> P = 1 / (1 + exp[-(−0.1311 + Predictor1 + 0.00687×Predictor4 + 0.0232×Predictor7)])</p>
      <p><strong>Model 2:</strong> 
         P_high = 1 / (1 + exp[−(−2.1102 + 0.2211×CellType + 0.00105×Predictor4 + 0.0338×Predictor7 + Predictor1)])<br>
         P_intermediate = 1 / (1 + exp[−(−0.1211 + 0.2211×CellType + 0.00105×Predictor4 + 0.0338×Predictor7 + Predictor1)])</p>

      <h2>Limitations of use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Well-exposure analysis was not conducted to measure free drug concentration in hiPSC-CM experiments.</li>
        <li>The tool does not account for drug metabolites, which should be investigated separately.</li>
        <li>Repolarization wave changes may be difficult to detect for blunted responses.</li>
        <li>Only acute (30 min) assay duration was examined; chronic exposures may require verification.</li>
      </ul>
