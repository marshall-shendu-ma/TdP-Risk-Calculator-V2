      <h2>Context of Use</h2>
      <p>Delayed ventricular repolarization can create a proarrhythmic environment that results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias including Torsades de pointes (TdP). A significant challenge in drug development and regulatory decision making is determining the proarrhythmic potential of novel compounds.</p>
      <p>The TdP risk categorization calculator tool is used to assess the TdP risk of small molecule compounds in healthy adults to create human-relevant data for greater evidence of safety assurance for drug development and regulatory decision making.</p>
      <p>Fitting of these results through machine learning algorithms were used to develop this open-source online calculator.</p>
      
<p>This calculator receives compound-induced input predictors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257217/#&gid=article-figures&pid=figure-1-uid-0" target="_blank">Predictor 1, Did compound induced arrhythmias occur at any concentration? (0=no arrhythmia, 1=type A arrhythmia, 2=any other arrhythmia type)</a></li>
  <li>Predictor 2, Were drug-induced arrhythmias observed at any concentration in ≥ 40% wells. (typically in at least 2 out of 5 replicate wells) (0=no, 1=yes)</li>
  <li>Predictor 3, Repolarization prolongation (ms) at the first drug concentration with statistically significant (p≤0.05) prolongation or shortening.</li>
  <li>Predictor 4, Maximum repolarization change (ms) observed at any concentration.</li>
  <li>Predictor 5, Drug concentration (folds over Cmax) at which the first statistically significant (p≤0.05) repolarization prolongation was first observed.</li>
  <li>Predictor 6, Drug concentration (folds over Cmax) when drug-induced arrhythmias were first observed.</li>
  <li>Predictor 7, Drug-induced repolarization change (ms) at Cmax.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Limitations of Use</h2>
  <p>While this study provides valuable insight into potential TdP risk categories it has some limitations described here (Blinova et al 2018).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Well-exposure analysis studies were not conducted to measure free drug concentration in hiPSC-CM experiments. Future studies should consider detailed well-exposure analysis to determine the amount of nonspecific binding.</li>
    <li>The tool does not account for drug metabolites as such active drug metabolites should be investigated independently.</li>
    <li>Repolarization wave can be decreased (blunted) following exposure to some compounds making it challenging to detect FPD prolongation.</li>
    <li>Only acute (30 minutes) assay duration was investigated. However, chronic timepoints (e.g., days to weeks) may be of interest for specific compounds (e.g., hERG trafficking inhibitors).</li>
    <li>This study was not statistically powered to investigate the effect of the electrophysiological device (platform) on the hiPSC-CM assay’s predictivity of proarrhythmic drug potential.</li>
    <li>This study was conducted on spontaneous beating (non-paced) hiPSC-CMs. Utilization of field stimulated (paced) input parameters (Patel et al 2019) will require additional verification and validation.</li>
    <li>To extend this tool to more complex in vitro models (e.g., co-culture, 3D, disease models) specific verification, validation and optimization will be required.</li>
    <li>This model was validated for two commercially available models iCell cardiomyocytes2 and Cor.4U cardiomyocytes. Utilization of additional hiPSC-CM models will require additional verification and validation.</li>
    <li>Best practices recommendations suggest inclusion of the predicted Cmax in the selection of drug concentrations to determine Predictor 7. Extrapolation of Predictor 7 may confound TdP risk categorization outputs.</li>
