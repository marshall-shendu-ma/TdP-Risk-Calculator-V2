# TdP Risk Assessment Categorization (TRAC) Calculator

The TRAC Calculator is an open-source, web-based tool for assessing **torsades de pointes (TdP) proarrhythmic risk** of small molecule compounds. It uses electrophysiological response predictors measured in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as part of the **Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA)** paradigm.

This tool implements a logistic regression–based model trained on large, multisite datasets, providing researchers and regulators with reproducible, human-relevant risk predictions.

## Running the Program

You can directly run the program in this package by visiting [the live TRAC Calculator webpage](https://tkfeaster.github.io/TRAC-Calculator/) and follow the instructions on the page.

## Features

- **Three validated predictors**:
  1. Arrhythmia-like event occurrence (categorical)
  2. Maximum repolarization change (ms) observed at any concentration
  3. Repolarization change (ms) at expected *Cmax*
- **Two input modes**:
  - Direct predictor input  
  - *Cmax* interpolation with concentration–response curve fitting (Hill curve with Hill coefficient fixed at 1)
- **Program outputs**:
  - Predicted probability of **Low risk** vs **High or Intermediate risk**
  - Bar chart of risk probabilities
  - Hill-fit concentration–response plot with *Cmax* overlay
- **Context of Use (COU)** and **Limitations** documented with links to key references.

## Getting Started

The TRAC Calculator is a browser-based app (no installation required). Clone or download this repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.

### Input Instructions
1. Review the [Context of Use](cou.html#coU) and [Limitations of Use](cou.html#limitations).
2. Enter predictor values in the **Predictor Inputs** panel.  
   - Predictor ranges are shown in the input fields upon startup.
3. Optionally, use the **Cmax Interpolation** panel to fit a concentration–FPDc curve and automatically generate predictors.
4. Click **Calculate** to view the outputs.

### Outputs
- Logistic regression model results are displayed under **Program Outputs**.  
- Graphical plots update dynamically:
  - Risk probability bar chart
  - Hill-fit concentration–response curve (if Cmax interpolation is used)
